## 🎓 **Conference, Recognition & Publication**

**Presented at the 2025 Metro State Student Scholar Research Conference**  
📎 https://libguides.metrostate.edu/student_research_conference  

**Selected by my Data Visualization professor as an exemplary project** to be shown to future students.

**Accepted for publication in the MetroWorks Student Research Collection**, scheduled for release **January 2026**.

## 🔍 **Overview**

This project examines how four audio environments influence study focus:

- **Silence (no audio)**
- **Instrumental Music (lo-fi and kawaii-style study tracks)**
- **Lecture Audio (recorded class lecture videos)**
- **Music with Lyrics (primarily K-pop and pop music)**

Over **14 days**, I recorded **87 study sessions**, tracking:

- Start and end time  
- Session duration  
- Activity  
- Audio environment  
- Session observations  
- A **1–5 focus rating**

The study initially followed my natural listening habits.  
Midway, I realized the environments were unevenly represented, so I deliberately added more **silence** and **instrumental** sessions to balance the dataset.

## 🎯 **Key Findings**

- **Silence** and **Instrumental music** produced the highest focus.  
- **Lecture Audio** and **Music with Lyrics** lowered concentration.  
- **Duration did not predict focus** — longer sessions did not increase focus.  
- **One-way ANOVA (p < 0.001)** confirmed statistically significant differences across environments.  
- **Tukey post-hoc tests** identified which environments differed from each other.

## 🛠️ **Tools Used**

- **R Programming Language**
- **tidyverse (dplyr, readxl, etc.)**
- **ggplot2** for data visualization  
- **ANOVA + TukeyHSD** for statistical testing  
- **Excel** for raw data collection  

---

## ⭐ **Skills Demonstrated**

- Experimental design and structured data logging  
- Data cleaning, wrangling, and factor ordering  
- Visualization: bar plots, boxplots, scatterplots  
- Statistical inference: ANOVA + Tukey  
- Communicating results through poster & oral presentation  
- Reproducible documentation in GitHub  
- Portfolio organization and project documentation  

---

## 🚀 **Future Improvements**

- Extend data collection beyond 14 days for stronger statistical power  
- Track additional variables (interruptions, mood, sleep, task difficulty)  
- Use **mixed-effects modeling** for repeated measures  
- Automate logging via Shiny app or mobile interface  
- Add confidence intervals and effect sizes  
- Compare productivity outcomes, not just focus  
- Explore machine learning classification of environments

## 💡 **Why This Study Matters**

This research demonstrates how everyday behaviors — like choosing background audio — directly influence productivity.  

The project highlights the power of combining:

- **real-world behavioral data**
- **statistical testing**
- **data visualization**
- **interpretation of trends**

It also serves as a practical example of how data analysis can improve personal study strategy.
