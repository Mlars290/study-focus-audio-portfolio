A 14-day self-study analyzing how different audio environments affect study focus. Includes poster, visualizations, summary findings, and statistical results (ANOVA + Tukey)

The Effect of Audio Environments on Study Focus and Productivity
14-Day Self-Study Using R, Data Visualization, and Statistical Analysis

Presented at the 2025 Metro State Student Scholar Research Conference
⭐ Selected by course faculty to be used as an example in future Data Visualization classes.

🔍 Overview

This project analyzes how four audio environments—Silence, Instrumental Music, Lecture Audio, and Music with Lyrics—affect study focus. I collected 87 study sessions over 14 days, recording duration, environment, activity, and a 1–5 focus rating.

🎯 Key Findings

Silence and Instrumental music produced the highest focus.

Music with lyrics and Lecture audio lowered focus.

Session length did not predict focus.

One-way ANOVA (p < 0.001) confirmed significant differences.

Tukey post-hoc tests identified which environments differed.

📊 Visualizations

The visualizations/ folder includes:

Average Focus Bar Plot

Duration Boxplot

Focus vs Duration Scatterplot

These were created in R using ggplot2.

🧪 Methods

Data logged manually in Excel

Cleaning + summarization with dplyr

Visualization with ggplot2

ANOVA + TukeyHSD for statistical comparison

📄 Poster

Full conference poster available in the poster/ folder.
