## 🧾 Abstract

This quantitative self-tracking study investigates how four distinct audio environments influence study focus and productivity.  
Across **87 logged study sessions over 14 days**, behavioral data were analyzed using **R, tidyverse workflows, data visualization, and one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc testing** to identify statistically significant differences in concentration across sound conditions.

## 🔍 Study Overview

### Audio Environments Examined
- **Silence** (no background audio)  
- **Instrumental Music** (lo-fi and ambient study tracks)  
- **Lecture Audio** (recorded instructional content)  
- **Music with Lyrics** (primarily K-pop and pop music)  

### Data Collected per Session
- Session timing and duration  
- Task activity  
- Audio environment  
- Observational notes  
- **Focus rating (1–5 scale)**  

Initial data reflected natural listening habits.  
Mid-study adjustments balanced representation of **silence** and **instrumental** conditions to support fair statistical comparison.

---

## 🎯 Key Findings

- **Silence** and **instrumental music** produced the **highest concentration levels**.  
- **Lecture audio** and **music with lyrics** were associated with **reduced focus**.  
- **Session duration showed no meaningful relationship** with focus.  
- **One-way ANOVA (p < 0.001)** confirmed significant differences across environments.  
- **Tukey post-hoc testing** identified which environments differed statistically.
